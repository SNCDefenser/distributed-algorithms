# distributed-algorithms

LeaderElection
This project consists of four parts: 
* build a message-passing synchronous distributed system in which nodes are arranged in a certain topology (given in a conﬁguration ﬁle)
* implement Peleg’s leader election algorithm to elect a leader
* build a breadth ﬁrst search (BFS) spanning tree rooted at the leader
* use the BFS tree to ﬁnd the maximum degree of any node in the BFS tree (not the network).

SynchGHS
* build a message-passing synchronous distributed system in which nodes are arranged in a certain topology (given in a configuration file)
* implement SynchGHS algorithm as described in the textbook for constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST)
